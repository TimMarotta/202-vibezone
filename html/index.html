                    about
                    once you get back! Right now, you may hear adults say that we are doing something called “social
                    distancing.” We are social distancing in order to prevent the coronavirus from spreading person to person. Even
                    though it is very hard to not leave your house and see other people, it is what is best to help stop the virus.
